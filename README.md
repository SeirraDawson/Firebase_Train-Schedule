# Firebase_Train-Schedule Homework

### Overview

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Setup

*  Make sure Firebase is used to store data, GitHub to backup the project, and GitHub Pages to host the finished site.

### Instructions

* Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:

  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:

    * Train Name

    * Destination

    * First Train Time -- in military time

    * Frequency -- in minutes

  * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.

  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

  * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
